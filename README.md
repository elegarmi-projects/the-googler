## Description
Marissa Ann Mayer is building a new team in Google, and you are her right hand. As her first decision to improve processes in her stream, she wants to launch a note-taking app.

Marissa personally asked you to create the app prototype that allows their users to:

- Login and register (no persistence required)
- Take a new note that contains two kinds of text:
    - Title
    - Description
- Visualize the notes in a grid/list view
- Add tags to the notes
- Delete notes
- Edit notes
